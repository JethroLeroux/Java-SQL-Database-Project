 A later fix from the jackcess trunk to the 2.0.5 release  has been included in this distribution. 
 It's limited to the class LongValueColumnImpl and it's about empty memo values. Source file version: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/jackcess/code/jackcess/trunk/src/main/java/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/impl/LongValueColumnImpl.java?p=884.
