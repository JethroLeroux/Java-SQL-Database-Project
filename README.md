# Java-SQL-Database-Project
Created a project in the Netbeans IDE that fetches, edits, and displays information from a Microsoft SQL database. 
The program was created for a mechanic's business and it allows the business to effectively process vehicles by letting the user 
keep track of all the work being done in the mechanic shop. It allows the user to see what vehicles need to be worked on, 
what vehicles have been paid for, input new vehicles into the system and much more. 
The program also allows for different levels of user authorization and requires a username and password to log in. 

### Use the username 'admin' and the password 'password' to log in.
